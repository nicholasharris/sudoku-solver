# sudoku-solver
C++ program that solves sudoku puzzles in terminal via recursive backtracking. Also uses some deduction tricks specific to sudoku puzzles to speed things up. Solves even the hardest puzzles in under 30 seconds (and easy puzzles in 1-2 seconds). Using only recursive backtracking the hardest of puzzles took approximately 6 hours to solve.

The lack of a GUI interface means the program is tedious to use (entering all clue numbers through the command line takes quite a bit of time). But as an exercise I felt this project was rewarding.

TO RUN: This code was only tested in Windows, specifically in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. To run, you may run the code within Visual Studio or use it to create a .exe, which has also been tested.
